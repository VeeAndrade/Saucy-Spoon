# Saucy Spoon Recipe Website

## Abstract

In this project, we created a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view their favorite recipes and plan shopping trips around them.

The project is broken up into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility.

Test driven development has been used to drive code.

Timeline was 1.5 weeks from forking repo to submitting project. 

## Goals and Objectives
 - Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
 - Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way
 - Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). 

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal. All tests are set up to pass.
